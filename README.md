# CHRandomKit

An easier & safer to use interface for good, cryptographically secure, random.
This framework is currently under development, and is subject to change.

## Use

`CHRandom` provides class methods for producing random data of fixed, and variable length with bounding constraints.

#### Example:

Generate a random `NSUInteger`:

    NSUInteger randInt = [CHRandom randomUnsignedInteger];
